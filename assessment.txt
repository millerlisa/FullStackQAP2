1. How many hours is it take to complete this assessment?
This assignment took me far too long. I couldn't get the log events to work for ages. Approximately 12 hours for this QAP. 

2. What online resources you have used? 
I watched and rewatched lectures, I watched the YouTube videos you posted plus some, copilot... so many questions to copilot.

3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems.
No.

4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? 
No. 
I probably would have availed on the support sessions if I was far enough into the projec to ask for help when these sessions happend.

5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question.
Tasks 1 & 2 didn't cause much trouble for me but task three stumped me at the end of the first day working on this, the entire second day and I finally got it working day 3. I hope I can solve similar problems since Sprint is mere hours away...
